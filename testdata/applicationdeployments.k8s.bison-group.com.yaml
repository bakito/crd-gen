                    resource should

                    be written. Connection details frequently include the

                    and password required to connect to the managed resource.

                    This field is planned to be replaced in a future release in

                    independently

                    and connection details would be published to both without
                    affecting

                    each other.

                    InitProvider holds the same fields as ForProvider, with the
                    exception

                    of Identifier and other resource reference fields. The

                    in InitProvider are merged into ForProvider when the
                    resource is created.

                    The same fields are also added to the terraform
                    ignore_changes hook, to

                    avoid updating them after creation. This is useful for
                    fields that are

                    required on creation, but we do not desire to update them
                    after creation,

                    for example because of an external controller is managing
                    them, like an
